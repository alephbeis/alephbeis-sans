# Alephbeis Sans

## About This Typeface

Alephbeis Sans is a Hebrew type family featuring simple, rational monolinear letterforms. Designed by Meir Sadan for the Alephbeis educational system, it was made to accompany the books, worksheets, interfaces and various materials used for teaching children how to read Hebrew. The shapes of the letters were originally based on  traditional book typefaces, and then evolved and rationalized to give the typeface a softer, rounder look. The typeface has relatively wide, squareish proportions which lend a young atmosphere to it.

After work on this typeface has been completed, Alephbeis made the decision to Open Source this project to  benefit the global community of Hebrew readers, especially those who are learning to read.

Features:
- 10 Weights ranging from Hairline to Black
- Full Hebrew vowel marks (nikkud)
- Arrows!
